I am a final-year student at the National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT Trichy), pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science and Engineering. I am currently working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at NIT Trichy under the guidance of faculty members, focusing on medical image classification and segmentation using deep learning techniques for retinal microvasculature and Foveal Avascular Zone (FAZ) analysis in OCTA images. My research aims to improve accuracy in detecting diabetic retinopathy and other eye diseases. I am also working on a project involving cross-domain knowledge distillation for multi-task learning for diabetic retinopathy classification and segmentation.

Additionally, I am a Research Intern at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, where I am involved in a research project on 2D to 3D reconstruction of coronary arteries from X-ray angiogram images. I am developing deep learning-based algorithms for 3D coronary artery mesh reconstruction and virtual fractional flow reserve (vFFR) computation.

Previously, I interned at A*STAR Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SimTech), where I worked on advanced semantic segmentation of particle defects in metal additive manufacturing using U-Net-based models with attention mechanisms. I also had the opportunity to work at the Centre for Neuroscience, IISc Bengaluru, where I analyzed muscle activation patterns through Independent Component Analysis (ICA) of surface Electromyogram (sEMG) signals.

My research interests lie in medical image segmentation, deep learning, multimodal neuroimaging, computer vision, and AI applications in healthcare. I am particularly focused on improving diagnostic accuracy for medical conditions using advanced image processing techniques and multimodal fusion.

I am also actively involved in extracurricular activities, serving as the President of the Office of International Relations at NIT Trichy, where I organize seminars and webinars to help students learn more about international opportunities and university admissions. I am an executive committee member of the IEEE Student Branch at NIT Trichy and have been a part of organizing various events and workshops.
