I am a final-year undergraduate student at the [National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli (NIT Trichy)](https://www.nitt.edu/), pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (Honors) in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science. Additionally, I am a final-year exchange student at the [Wadhwani School of Data Science and AI](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/), [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/).

Currently, I am a Research Intern at the [MiRL Lab](https://ed.iitm.ac.in/~gankrish/), Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, under the guidance of [Prof. Ganapathy Krishnamurthi](https://dsai.iitm.ac.in/faculty/ganapathy-krishnamurthi/). My research involves 2D to 3D reconstruction of coronary arteries from X-ray angiogram images and the analysis of vFFR computation techniques. Concurrently, I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [MIC-AIH Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mic-aih-lab/posts/?feedView=all), ECE Department, NIT Trichy, under the supervision of [Prof. Varun P. Gopi](https://www.nitt.edu/home/academics/departments/ece/faculty/varun/), focusing on retinal microvasculature and Foveal Avascular Zone segmentation in OCTA images using deep learning. My work also includes cross-domain knowledge distillation for multi-task learning in diabetic retinopathy classification and segmentation in OCTA images, as well as multimodal medical image data fusion for accurate prediction of Alzheimer's disease.

Previously, I interned at [A*STAR Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/simtech) under Mr. Dong Chaoyu, where I worked on advanced semantic segmentation of particle defects in metal additive manufacturing. I also served as a Summer Research Fellow at the [Movement Control Lab](https://cns.iisc.ac.in/aditya/), Centre for Neuroscience, [Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/), under the guidance of [Prof. Aditya Murthy](https://cns.iisc.ac.in/people/aditya-murthy/). There, I analyzed muscle activation patterns through the decomposition of single-channel sEMG signals using Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

My research focuses on computer vision, multimodal fusion, signal and image processing, and AI, with a strong emphasis on diagnostic and prognostic applications in healthcare.
